          'The landscape outside the window went through 212 processes and became a pale blue landscape, and the body became lighter than anyone else.'
          <br><br>
          This process involved opening landscape images taken during a journey on the computer screen, then repeating the cycle by capturing the image again with a phone. Even in the simple process of capturing an image with a phone and transferring it back to the computer, information within the image continues to be lost, and the body gradually becomes lighter.

          <br>3. Take another photo of the image opened on the computer.

          <br>5. Take another photo of the image opened on the computer.
